# blazeset

## Have you ever...
- spent hours after installing Windows?
- needed to set up multiple machines?
- needed to re-do your setup?
- wanted to share your Windows setup to others?
- wished [Nix](https://nixos.org/) was on Windows?
- wished there was a faster, more reliable way to setup your environment?

## That's what blazeset is for!
blazeset is a **modern, powerful tool** designed to **configure your Windows environment declaratively**.

It allows you to define your desired system configuration **declaratively using YAML** and **other programming languages** using [Extism](https://extism.org/).

blazeset applies your configuration with ***blazingly fast*** speed thanks to **Rust** and **concurrent architecture.**

## How is it different from [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io/)?
blazeset is inspired from [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io/), but improved.

blazeset is **built with Rust**, has **concurrent architecture** and **provides APIs to other programming languages** for more complex tasks.
